            <h2>The Dangers of Boredom</h2>
            <p>According to the BBC, "Boredom, it turns out, can be a dangerous and disruptive state 
                of mind that damages your health â€“ and even cuts years off your lifespan."  Long story short, boredom 
                is BAD for your health.  Fighting boredom on a daily basis is essential to a happy, healthy life, and 
                you owe it to yourself and your kids to do all you can to help.
